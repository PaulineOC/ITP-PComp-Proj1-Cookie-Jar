# ITP-PComp-Proj1-Cookie-Jar
Proj 1 Code

Notes from my meeting with Prof Rozin: 
* Use noTone() -- may crash if wasn't playing previously; may need to give a duration to stop it? 
* To play mp3: may need to use mp3 (search up arduino playback mp3)
* Use FSR to scale to see intentions (taken from /given to jar) of the cookie; potential to punish bingers?
* Use Arduino to meausure time--> use millis();
